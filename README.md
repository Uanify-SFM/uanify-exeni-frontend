# exeni

Exeni allows saving, extracting and sending images via WhatsApp. This repository is part of the exeni working environment used for Salud Digna to have its own image repository. 

This project simulates a copy of "Google Drive" but adapted to the needs of Salud Digna. It is possible to view the studies per patient and thus access the images and videos of each study performed.

## Let's get started

1. Copy the repository link.
2. Locate a folder on your computer where you want to save the repository and type in the terminal "git clone https://github.com/Uanify-SFM/uanify-exeni-frontend/".
3. Once the repository has finished downloading, open the folder with an editor of your choice.

### Pre-requisites

- Node must be installed (latest version April 2024).
- You must have a code editor installed
- Git must be installed (Windows, MacOs or Linux)

### Installation

1. Once you have the project open in your code editor you will need to type the command "yarn install". This will install all the packages needed for the project to run correctly.
2. Once the installation of the necessary packages is finished type in the terminal "yarn run dev".
3. Then you will have to go to the address shown in the console to view the project.
